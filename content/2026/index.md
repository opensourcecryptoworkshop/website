## Call for Proposals

We are requesting proposals for in-person sessions and talks, including presentations and hands-on demonstrations, on topics of interest to those who work on and with open source cryptography. Stipends for speakers are available.

Please respond to the [Call for Proposals here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zLd46CWxPPMJEzikdHajrPeCDRAjhzstTEKRfTjZO1g).

The organizers will be in touch within 1 month of your submission. Submissions are due 31 January 2026.

## Registration

Since OSCW is an affiliated event of RWC, attendees register for this workshop via [the IACR portal](https://rwc.iacr.org/2026/registration.php). It is possible to register _only_ for OSCW without registering for RWC.

**Note: As the sponsor of OSCW 2026, Google will cover the [cost of attending OSCW](https://rwc.iacr.org/2026/registration.php) (150 USD) if your organization is not covering your registration fee. Please apply by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/mj1YP7WrfSKEm9EC6).**

The waiver token must be used when you register, as it cannot be retroactively applied. The organizers will be in touch with waiver tokens within 1 week of your submission.

A late registration surchange is applied after 6 February 2026.
