OSCW 2026 will take place before [Real World Crypto](https://rwc.iacr.org/2026/) as an [affiliated event](https://realworldcrypto.iacr.org/2026/affiliated.php) on 8 March 2026 at the [Biomedical Translation Research Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hRgVz3kRcHLRBacP6) at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en) in Taipei, Taiwan.

## Call for Proposals

We are requesting proposals for in-person sessions and talks, including presentations and hands-on demonstrations, on topics of interest to those who work on and with open source cryptography. Stipends for speakers are available.

Please respond to the [Call for Proposals here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zLd46CWxPPMJEzikdHajrPeCDRAjhzstTEKRfTjZO1g).

The organizers will be in touch within 1 month of your submission. Submissions are due 31 January 2026.
