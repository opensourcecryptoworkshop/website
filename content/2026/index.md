OSCW 2026 will take place before [Real World Crypto](https://rwc.iacr.org/2026/) as an [affiliated event](https://realworldcrypto.iacr.org/2026/affiliated.php) on 8 March 2026 at the [Biomedical Translation Research Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hRgVz3kRcHLRBacP6) at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en) in Taipei, Taiwan.

## Call for Proposals

We are requesting proposals for in-person sessions and talks, including presentations and hands-on demonstrations, on topics of interest to those who work on and with open source cryptography. Stipends for speakers are available.

Please respond to the [Call for Proposals here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zLd46CWxPPMJEzikdHajrPeCDRAjhzstTEKRfTjZO1g).

The organizers will be in touch within 1 month of your submission. Submissions are due 31 January 2026.

## Registration

Since OSCW is an affiliated event of RWC, attendees register for this workshop via [the IACR portal](https://rwc.iacr.org/2026/registration.php). It is possible to register _only_ for OSCW without registering for RWC.

Note: As the sponsor of OSCW, Google is covering the cost of attending OSCW (150 USD) for people who do not have their registration fee covered by their organization. The waiver token must be used while you register, as they cannot be retroactively applied. Please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/5FmkKBCNNTv2x7F59), and the organizers will be in touch with waiver tokens within 1 week of your submission.

A late registration surchange is applied after 6 February 2026.
