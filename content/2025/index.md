Tommaso Gagliardoni is a mathematician, cryptographer, and cybersecurity expert. He published peer-reviewed papers in the areas of cryptography, quantum security, and privacy, and spoke at many international conferences in these fields (CRYPTO, EUROCRYPT, ASIACRYPT, CCS, Black Hat Europe, DEF CON Demo Labs, etc.). He is known, among other achievements, for his collaborations in solving the longstanding problem of adaptive quantum authentication (EUROCRYPT 2018, TQC 2019) and breaking the security of ISO-standard smart card protocol PLAID (Real World Crypto 2015, SSR 2015).  As a subject expert, he serves as a Program Committee member at academic conferences such as PQCRYPTO, and collaborates with the World Economic Forum, NIST, and other official agencies in the context of international treaties, development programs, and standardization processes on emerging technologies. Expert in blockchain, Web3 and DeFi, Tommaso has performed cryptographic code audits for clients such as Binance, Coinbase, ING, Swiss Post. Additionally, he has a background in privacy hacktivism, investigative journalism, and ethical hacking, speaking at venues such as the international Journalism Festival and the E-Privacy Meeting. Tommaso obtained a PhD at the Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany, with a dissertation on the quantum security of cryptographic primitives. He was postdoctoral researcher at IBM Research Zurich and cryptography tech lead at Kudelski Security before joining Horizen Labs in 2025, where he is currently senior research scientist. 


### Thomas Holenstein
