If you would like to learn more about open source cryptographic libraries and projects, specifically challenges surrounding their production, maintenance, and usage, then this workshop is for you!

The Open Source Cryptography Workshop (OSCW) brings together practitioners interested in topics such as:

- the developer and user experience associated with open source cryptography projects,</li>
- the production and maintenance challenges of open source cryptography projects,</li>
- improving the downstream effects of security fixes on dependent projects, and</li>
- best practices for designing clean-sheet crypto systems with modern primitives.
